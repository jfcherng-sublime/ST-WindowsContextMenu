# WindowsContextMenu Changelog

## 1.2.1

- refactor: use `sublime_text.exe` rather than `subl.exe`

  Same for `sublime_merge.exe` / `smerge.exe`.
  See https://github.com/jfcherng-sublime/ST-WindowsContextMenu/issues/2 for more details.

  Unfortunately, to make this change work for you, you have to re-add existing context menus.
